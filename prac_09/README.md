# Practical 9 - Strings & Files

Write your answers for the early non-coding questions in a simple text file called `questions.txt`.

## Quick Questions

1. Explain the difference between the `'r'` and `'w'` modes when opening a file.
2. What is a **file object** and how is it different from a file name or the file's contents?
3. Why is it necessary to close a file after it has been opened and used?
4. What is a good principle for deciding whether a literal value should be stored in a CONSTANT?
5. Write a **single Python expression** that would evaluate to the file extension of a variable like  
   `filename = "this_is_a_name.txt"` or `filename = "document.docx"`  
   In those two examples, the result of the expression would be `txt` and `docx` respectively.
6. What is a good number of quick questions to have at the start of a practical?

## Logic Exercise

Consider the following list of 3 statements:

- There is exactly 1 false statement in this list.
- There are exactly 2 false statements in this list.
- There are exactly 3 false statements in this list.

How many false statements are there in the list; 0, 1, 2 or 3?

> It's helpful to comment in/out the _calls_ to these functions so that you only run the one you're working on.

## Strings

File: `strings.py`

### 1. Processing Strings

First, let's see another quick example of using slicing and finding.  
Suppose we have data like:

```python
string = "Result = 95%"
```

and we want to extract just the percentage as a number.  
If we know that the format will be just like that, we can use:

```python
value = int(string[-3:-1])
```

But what if it might be different, like:

```python
string = "Final Score = 8%"
# or 
string = "Relative Value = 178.3%"
```

In those cases, our overly-simplistic approach would not work.

Ideally, we need a robust way of extracting the data, based on the possible values that the string could have.  
So, in this case, let's assume we want all the characters between the `= ` and the `%` (which would be valid in all 3 of
these cases).

One way to do this is to `find` the index of the space after the = and then slice all the characters from there to one
before the end.  
Since we did this in the lecture, the rest is up to you now...

**Write a program in `question_1()`** that processes this list of strings (copy the data provided) and prints the values
you extract.

```python
data_strings = ["Result = 95%", "Final Score = 8%", "Relative Value = 178%",
                "Something else that's very important = 9.2%", "x = 42%"]
```  

**Hint**: Don't try and get your processing/extraction working at the same time as your for loop.  
Pick one string and work on that. When it works, add in your loop to see how it works with the others.

Sample output (notice what types these outputs are):

```
95.0
8.0
178.0
9.2
42.0
```

Last note: There's no obvious 'meaning' in this data, so you can use generic names.  
You're given _strings_, and you need to extract a _value_ from each.

### 2. Date Strings

(Similar to a question from the lecture)  
Write a program in `question_2()` to extract and display only the year from a date of birth stored as a string
like `"13/07/1995"`

- Ask the user for their DOB and store it as a string
- Then tell them how old they will be next year
- Remember to think about CONSTANTS for any 'magic numbers' you reuse

Sample output (as at 2022):

```
DOB: 13/07/1995
You were born in 1995.
You will turn 28 in 2023.
```

### 3. Subject Code Strings

The first 3 characters in JCU subject codes always follow a definite pattern:  
The first 2 characters are the discipline (MA = Maths, CP = IT, etc.) and the next character is the year level.  
Who knows what the last 3 characters mean? :)

**Write pseudocode for this question.**  
Then, write a program in `question_3()` that asks for subject codes until the user enters a blank one...   
Hey, sounds familiar... BUT this question does not use lists, so you have to change it!   
After the user enters each one, print what year level it is and whether it's an IT subject.

Sample Output (Consider carefully your decision structures here):

```
Enter subject code: CP1401
That is a first-year IT subject.
Enter subject code: MA2403
That is a second-year subject.
Enter subject code: CP5639
That is a Masters or other IT subject.
Enter subject code: PH3456
That is a third-year subject.
Enter subject code: 
```

**Hint**: A nice way to do this is with a single print statement that uses variables.  
You do not want to repeat yourself (DRY), right?  
So don't use lots of different print statements... just look at what's different (different = variable).  
E.g.,

```python
print(f"That is a {year_string}{it_string} subject.")
```

# Python Coding - Files Example

Let's walk through a complete example, from problem description, through problem solving to code and testing.  
Just read along and understand. Do not "do" any of this until asked, just read it and make sure you understand.

### Problem Description:

Geraldine Gamer likes to record her gaming scores, so each day she types her best score as a floating-point number into
the file "scores.txt".  
She wants to process this file and find out what her average score is.

### Algorithm

- We need to open the file for _reading_ and close it at the end.
- We know that each line is the same kind of data, so we can process it with a definite loop, doing the same thing per
  line.  
  We process _each_ line, so that's definite (for loop), not _until_ some condition happens.
- We should know the "accumulation pattern" by now, so the total and average should be easy.

```
total = 0.0
count = 0
open "scores.txt" for reading as in_file
for line in in_file
    score = line as float
    total = total + score
    count = count + 1
close in_file
average = total / count
print average
```

### Code

Note: we don't usually use the variable name `file` because we'd like to know whether it's for reading input
from (`in_file`) or writing output to (`out_file`).  
These are not world-standard kind of names, but they are more meaningful than `file` or `f`, etc. and should help us
avoid trying to write output to an input file or vice versa.

```python
total = 0.0
count = 0
in_file = open("scores.txt", 'r')
for line in in_file:
    score = float(line)
    total += score
    count += 1
in_file.close()
average = total / count
print(f"Average = {average:.1f}")
```

Notice also that we `close` the file as soon as we've finished with it (not at the end of the program).

### Testing

Test data for this kind of program is stored in a file.  
Copy the numbers below into a new file (not Python file) called `scores.txt`, saved in the same folder as this prac's
program files.   
Or you can [download scores.txt from here](./scores.txt).

```
56.8
34.0
45.5
49.3
```

Output

```
Average = 46.4
```

### Things to do

Create a new Python file, `example.py`.      
**Now, you type this code in (don't copy it)**, and **test it** to see you got the expected output.  
The reason you want to _type_ instead of _copy_ this code is because it helps you learn to use the IDE (e.g., use
autocomplete!), type code accurately, and develop an eye for detail.

- The filename in the program is a literal, but we can easily make it a variable and ask the user for the file name.  
  Do this now. Note that if the file doesn't exist, the program will crash and that's fine for now...  
  We'll learn how to handle exceptions in Programming 2.  
  Test it with a different file, like [recentrain.txt](./recentrain.txt).

- Currently, the program just prints the final average.  
  **Make it print a running total**, so output would look like:

```
Score = 56.8   Total so far =   56.8
Score = 34.0   Total so far =   90.8
Score = 45.5   Total so far =  136.3
Score = 49.3   Total so far =  185.6
Average = 46.4
```

If you're not sure how to do the lining up using string formatting, you can check
the [example.py file here](./example.py).

# Coding Exercises - Files

(Unless otherwise specified) Write all your answers to the following questions in a single Python file
called `files.py`  
At the top of each program, put a comment with the exercise number/name (copy-and-paste it from here) so you/we know
what the program is for later.

## 4. Read a String from a File

Create a new text file in your prac_09 directory called `name.txt`.  
Type _only_ your own name in the file.

Write a program in `question_4()` that _reads_ this `name.txt` file and greets you, example:

```
Greetings Lindsay!
```

Note that since we want the entire contents of the file in one string, we don't need any kind of loop, we can
just `read` the file, like:

```python
in_file = open("name.txt", "r")
text = in_file.read()
```

Did it work?  
If you got something like

```
Greetings Lindsay
!
```

Then what happened is the `text` variable includes the new line character (`\n`) in your file.  
You can solve this problem in two ways.

- Edit the file so there's no new line
- Strip the new line character (any whitespace from the ends of the line) from text with:

```python
text = in_file.read().strip()
```

## 5. Greater-Than Counter

**Write pseudocode for this question.**  
**Write a program in `question_5()`** that _reads_ a user-specified file of floating-point numbers, and counts how many
of those numbers are
larger than a user-specified threshold.  
You can see from the example output below that the program determines the number of numbers/lines from reading the
file.  
Your program should work for any file of numbers (one per line) of any size.  
The example below has 10 lines, but yours might have 365 or 2 or...  
We ALWAYS write algorithms and code to solve general problems (within reason), so you rarely hard-code something like
the length/size of a file.

### Example file:

Copy the numbers below into a new file called `recentrain.txt`,  
or [download recentrain.txt here](./recentrain.txt).

```
12.4
10.0
10.1
0
8.4
13.9
19.1
141.0
33.5
1.2
```

### Example output:

```
Filename: recentrain.txt
Threshold: 13.9
Processing...
3 out of 10 (30.0%) values in recentrain.txt are greater than 13.9.
```

## 6. File Filter

Write a program in `question_6()` that _reads_ a file and "filters" it, _writing_ only certain lines to another file.  
In the lecture, we wrote a program that read [letter.txt](./letter.txt) and printed every line that started with a
capital.

For this exercise, write a program that asks the user for three things:

- input file name
- output file name
- a search string to look for lines that contain it

Read the input file, and then for each line that contains the search string, write that line to the output file.

### Optional - Version 2:

Copy your program and make a "version 2" that searches differently:

- Search only for lines that _start with_ the search string.  
  Python has a very helpful string method for this: `startswith`.  
  `"hello".startswith("he")  # this is True`    
  E.g., Lindsay starts a lot of sentences with "So". So, if you had a [transcript file](./transcript.txt) of one of his
  lectures and searched for "So", you could make a new file that contained those sentences.
- Filter in other ways (not based on a user string), like lines that start with numbers or vowels or white space, etc.  
  Explain your choice of filter/search in comments.

#### Interesting Examples:

You would need to `strip()` the lines to account for indenting in some of these.

- The practical instructions file you are reading now is a "Markdown" text file. The headings all start with '#'.  
  If the user chose this file and searched for '#', then the output file would contain all the headings.
- Similarly, HTML headings are `<h1>`, `<h2>` etc. so you could filter/strip those.
- Python comments use `#` or `"""`, so why not try getting your program to extract just the comments.

## 7. BMI Files

File: `bmi_files.py`

Write a program that writes to and then reads from `bmis.txt` (not at the same time).  
Reuse your functions from [Prac 6](../prac_06/README.md#example) (and 7) where you calculated a person's BMI based on
height and weight.  
Notice that if you wrote good, well-designed functions (following SRP), you can simply reuse them for this different
scenario!

Copy and use the following main:

```python
def main():
    """BMI program using files."""
    filename = input("Filename: ")
    number_of_people = int(input("Enter the number of people: "))
    save_bmis(number_of_people, filename)
    print()
    display_bmi_categories(filename)
```

The first function, `save_bmis` should ask the user for a number of people, then repeatedly ask for the details (height
and weight) for that many people.  
_(You did just think of what kind of loop to use, didn't you?)_

For each person, calculate their BMI, but don't print it to the screen...   
write the BMI to the file `bmis.txt`.  
**Your file should simply contain one BMI value per line.**  
Don't forget to close the file when you have finished.

Test this and confirm it works as you expect by opening and checking the file in PyCharm.

**When your first part works**, write the second function, `display_bmi_categories`, which should read the file and
display the BMI and
weight category similar to how we've done it before.

> [!NOTE]  
> These two functions might look like they breach SRP and do more than one thing.  
> But we're OK with it. The main program is nice and simple and the two functions are the two main sections.  
> We're not going to reuse these functions for different things like we do with `calculate_bmi` and others.

### Sample Output

    Filename: bmis.txt
    Enter the number of people: 2
    Person 1
    Enter height (m) : 1.75
    Enter weight (kg): 67
    Person 2
    Enter height (m) : 2
    Enter weight (kg): 55.4
    
    BMI Categories
    BMI 21.9, considered normal
    BMI 13.8, considered underweight

Before you finish, here's one way to check that you've done this properly.  
Temporarily, comment-out the `save_bmis` call and see that your program should still run, printing the categories from
the last run by opening the file with the last set of BMI values.  
Uncomment that line when you know it works OK.  

# How are you going with the fundamentals?

In *all* of your programs by now, you should have clear ideas about the fundamental principles we've learned, so how
would these principles apply to this exercise/program?

- You know if you have to refer to the filename (literal) more than once, then it should be a variable or CONSTANT,
- You know SRP... your functions should not (usually) print, when they should return... so you can reuse the exact
  same (bmi) function from prac 6 for this program,
- The above is also an example of DRY - don't repeat yourself with a function that is really similar to one you already
  have,
- You know you use definite iteration (for loop) for things like a fixed number of times,
- You know every time you open a file, you should close it as soon as you're finished,
- You know your names must be meaningful,
- You know programming is fun...

# Practice and Extension

These final sections in practicals are not _required_ to be completed for marks, but you will definitely find benefit in
completing them for extra practice and to extend yourself.  
The more practice you do, the more you develop and "lock in" your new skills.

Create a new file, `practice.py` to complete these tasks in:

- Write a program that asks the user for a filename, opens that file and then simply prints how many lines are in the
  file.
- Write a program that asks the user for a filename, opens that file and then simply prints the number of characters in
  the file.
- Write a program that asks the user for a phrase and a filename, opens that file and then searches the file for the
  phrase, printing either "Found" or "Not found".
- Write the programs from the "Do this now" in the lecture, including the one that prints only the lines
  of [letter.txt](./letter.txt) that start with a capital.

## Write Numbers to a File

**Write a complete Python program** that _writes_ a range of numbers to a file.  
Here is the algorithm partly done for you in pseudocode:

```
open file "range.txt" for writing as out_file
for number in range ? to ? in steps of ?
    write number to out_file
close out_file
```

It is up to you what range to generate.  
Try these, and some of your own ideas:

- all the odd numbers from 0 to 99
- 0 to 100 in 10's
- 20, 19, 18... 0

Run your program each time with different ranges - commenting out the range line when you make a new one (so you keep
the old one).

# Extension

## i. Generating A File Of Random Floating-Point Numbers

Write a program that writes a customised collection of random integers to a file.  
Ask the user for the inputs as below, then generate the file.  
So,

```
Enter the filename: RandomNumbers.txt
Enter the minimum integer: 12
Enter the maximum integer: 50
Enter the number of random integers to generate: 9
```

would produce, `RandomNumbers.txt` containing something (random) like:

```
22
45
41
19
31
23
40
28
20
```

## ii. Simple File Statistics

Given a file with a floating-point number on each line, write a program that will calculate:

a. the total b. the average (arithmetic mean)
c. the minimum d. the maximum e. the median (harder - you will need to use a list)
