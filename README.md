## Marking

Assessment will be based on completing the tasks up to but not including
the practice/extension section.

> [!NOTE]
> This subject is all about learning best-practices and clean coding using
> the [patterns taught](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).
> It is important that you learn these important foundations according to the teaching of the subject.  
> So, to help your learning, prac work must be done in the way that we prescribe to achieve full marks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Here are some reasons that you might lose marks for your practicals and assignments:
> - Your work looks too similar to any provided solutions, code found online or answers made by services like ChatGPT
> - You miss or skip part of a question (you must attempt all requirements)
> - Your work includes concepts and code not taught in the subject
> - Your work does not follow the core concepts and patterns taught (e.g., using global variables, while True loops or
    similar techniques), even if they work!

## Submission

As of 2026, your weekly practical work will be submitted as a single 'portfolio' assessment item, as outlined in the
subject documentation.
Please submit your practical portfolio correctly, so that you can receive marks for your work.

- Do not zip up your files.
- Submit your practical with each file attached to one submission.
- If you need to resubmit additional attempts, you must include all files in the new submission.
- Ensure each file has the correct name, including the extension. If you don't use the right extensions, we cannot read
  your work in LearnJCU.
- Ensure your code is not commented-out. Only comments should be commented.
- Include a `# comment` as a heading for questions, or sub-parts of questions.
  E.g., if a question has parts `a.` and `b.` then add comments
  like `# a.` and `# b.` to make it clear where your answers are, and to help yourself know what you need to complete.
- Rewrite any provided `# TODO` comments as appropriate.

## Solutions

Selected practical solutions are provided here, in the **"solutions"** branch.  
These are to help you learn from evaluating your own work and seeing our suggested ways of solving the practical
problems.

Not all solutions are provided.  
Not all provided solutions are complete.
E.g., a question may require pseudocode and code, but its solution may only have code.  
This is on purpose.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please use the solutions in a mature and honest way, as helpful learning tools...  
> _after_ you complete your own work, _not_ as something to simply copy into your own prac work. OK?  
> Seriously, **never copy the solutions** as this will not help you learn as much as doing your own work.

## Save your practical work

You need to save your work for every prac. Keep every file you write.  
We suggest you use OneDrive and organise it using folders, like `CP1401/cp1401practicals/prac_01`.  
As explained in the practical instructions, use a single PyCharm project for practicals, with each prac in its own
folder.  
Please make sure you have suitable backups.
