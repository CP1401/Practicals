CP1401 Practical 01 - Problem Solving - Suggested Solutions

(Remember that only selected solutions are provided, not all.)

Algorithms

Don't forget to follow both our examples and our guide:
https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Pseudocode-Guide

Algorithm with I, P, O

get dose, yield
ratio = yield / dose
display ratio

Algorithm with Selection (Decision)

Note: Remember to use names from the "problem domain".
In this case we have the problem:
"Write an algorithm to determine if you can afford to buy an item based on its price and the money you have in your pocket."
So, we could consider the terms provided:
"item price" (reworked based on the sentence structure)
"money you have in your pocket"
We could abbreviate these to "price" and "money", but they sound too similar.
We need to differentiate names clearly.
Let's go with:

get pocket_money, item_price
if pocket_money >= item_price
    display can afford
else
    display can not afford

Note: we could write lots of different things to figure out how much money we have in our collection of coins, e.g.
pocket_money = add up value of coins
or
pocket_money = 0
for each coin in collection
    pocket_money = pocket_money + value of coin
etc.
But let's just keep it simple...

Algorithm with Repetition

get thing from floor
while there are things on the floor
    get thing from floor

or

repeat until floor is clean
    get thing from floor

This is a pretty "loose" question, and would not be turned into code, so we don't need a very "tight" (specific) answer.
If we were writing code to instruct a cleaning robot, then we'd need something much more complete and specific.


Problem Decomposition

"A road trip planning system will ask the user for the distance travelled (in km) and the travel time in minutes. The user will then be shown the average speed (in km/hour) over the trip."
Nouns: system, user, distance, time in minutes, average speed
Verbs: ask, shown

Algorithm

get distance, time in minutes
speed in kilometres per minute = distance / time in minutes
speed in kilometres per hour = in kilometres per minute * 60
display in kilometres per hour

Note: To help evaluate your own work, you should always TEST using values you understand.
If I were doing 25 km/hr then in 2 hours, I'd drive 50 km.
So,
distance = 50
time in minutes = 120 (2 hours)
speed in kilometres per minute = 50 / 120 (0.4166666667)
speed in kilometres per hour = 0.4166666667 * 60, which is 25
Good :)

If we had incorrectly written
speed in kilometres per hour = in kilometres per minutes * 60
Then we could find out this was wrong by testing and getting 0.006944443333 km/hr!
If we didn't test it... we wouldn't know!
