# Practical 04 - Repetition Structures

Write your answers for the early non-coding questions in a simple text file called `questions.txt`.

## Quick Questions

1. What is the PyCharm keyboard shortcut for commenting (out/in) a selection of code?
2. What are the two kinds of loops available in Python?
3. What is a "sentinel" (when dealing with loops)?
4. What is wrong with this variable name: `nothingWrong`
5. What are augmented assignment operators?

### range

*a)* Add a new heading "**Loop Outputs**" to your questions.txt file, then:  
Write the output of each of the following `for` loops that use `range`.

Then, when you have finished writing your output - **not before!** - copy the code into a Python program and run these
loops to check your answers.

```python
# 1.	
for i in range(6):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 2.	
for i in range(33, 39):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 3.	
for i in range(17, 11, -1):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 4.	
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i % 2, end=' ')
print()

# 5.	
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i ** 2, end='>')
print()
```

*b)* Add a new heading "**Range Values**" to your questions.txt file, then:  
Write the range statements (just range and parameters, not the whole loop) equivalent to the following lists of numbers:

1. [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2. [1, 5, 9, 13]

3. [3, 2, 1]

4. [7, 4, 1, -2, -5]

## Patterns

We have learned that there are 2
main [repetition patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#repetition-structures) and when
to use them (the "best tool for the job"):

- definite (for loops)
- indefinite (while loops)

**Which pattern** would be the most appropriate choice for each of the following situations:

1. Error-checking user input, looping until they enter a valid response
2. A menu with several options including 'quit'
3. Displaying all the months in a year
4. Printing 5 random numbers
5. Printing n random numbers, where n is a user input

## Logic Exercise

There are three boxes, which each contain two marbles:

- one has two white,
- one has two black, and
- one has one white and one black marble.

Each of the boxes also is labeled as to its contents,
but the labels have been swapped around and each label is _incorrect_.  
What is the fewest number of marbles you could remove from the boxes and look at in order to definitely determine the
contents of all three boxes?

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a very interesting exercise, and one you might not get correct without thinking about it carefully.  
> **Hint**: Make sure you are using all the information you have been provided with, and think about which is the best
> choice to start with.

# Python Coding - Repetition Structures

## Example

Let's walk through a complete example, from problem description, through problem solving to code and testing.  
Read along and understand. Do not "do" any of this; just read it and make sure you understand, until you get to the
section that asks you to do something.

Often, it is impossible for a program to proceed correctly if the user has entered an invalid value.  
A simple and general pattern for validating user input has been taught in class and is below.
> [!NOTE]  
> When you see *"general patterns"* in programming, you need to learn these, because you will be reusing them again
> and again.  
> There may be other ways, but the general patterns are usually the best in most situations.  
> **Pay attention to patterns like this!**

[Here is our standard error-checking (while loop) pattern](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#error-checking):

```
get input
while <input is not valid>
     display error message
     get input
<do something with input> (at this point, we know that the input entered is valid)
```

### Problem Description:

In this example, we want to ask the user to enter the month of their birthday as a number (so only a month between 1 and
12 is valid), then we will print each of the months of the year up to their birth month.

Sample output:

```
Enter your birth month: -1
Invalid month
Enter your birth month: 13
Invalid month
Enter your birth month: 4
1 2 3 4 
```

### Algorithm

If we analyse the description, we should see that:

- we have two loops
- the first is an error-checking loop, which we can see because the month needs to be "valid"
- the second is a loop that prints "each" of the months up to the input month

We should recognise the type of loops we need:

- the first will repeat *indefinitely* - until we get a valid month, or "while" the birth month is bad
- the second will repeat *definitely* - from 1 up to the birth month

Don't forget to make use of our
useful [Guide to Good Pseudocode](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Pseudocode-Guide).

```
get birth_month
while birth_month < 1 or birth_month > 12
    display error message
    get birth_month

for i from 1 to birth_month
    display i
```

### Code

```python
birth_month = int(input("Enter your birth month: "))
while birth_month < 1 or birth_month > 12:
    print("Invalid month")
    birth_month = int(input("Enter your birth month: "))

for i in range(1, birth_month + 1):
    print(i, end=" ")
print()
```

Notice again, like last week, that we can not shortcut the condition â€“ it is:
`while month < 1 or month > 12:`
not:
`while month < 1 or > 12:`

Notice another thing...  
The pseudocode is very similar to the code, but it does not need to be exact.  
We do not need to specify things like the `+ 1` or `end=" "` or the last `print` because those aren't fundamental parts
of solving the problem.

### Testing

To test this kind of input validation program, we need to do the usual:

- Test the normal situations
- Test the abnormal situations
- Test the boundary conditions

For our month number checking loop, we should check with values:

- 5 (or anything 1-12) (first, just try it with something valid in the first instance - we should get no loop)
- 1 and 12 (boundary conditions - which should be valid months)
- 0, 13 (just outside the boundaries)
- and we should test with looping no times (as we did first) and multiple times, not just once.

### Things to do

Create a new Python file, `example.py` (File > New > Python File)    
**Now, you type this code in (don't copy it)**, and **test it** with some other values.  
The reason you want to _type_ instead of _copy_ this code is because it helps you learn to use the IDE, type code
accurately, and develop an eye for detail. Use autocomplete!

#### Changes

Now update your program as follows:

- Print whether the birth month is in the first or second half of the year
- I spy some "magic numbers"... While it's unlikely that we'll need to change 1 or 12, we are repeating them. **Replace
  these literals with named CONSTANTS**.
- When you've got the above working, **use these constants in the prompt**, so it would print like:
  `Enter the month number (1-12): `  
  Note: This is a good case for some more string formatting. Here are a few options to achieve a string like that.  
  Which do you like best? (Hint: you like the f-string version best.)

```python
# Using the format method:
month = int(input("Enter the month number ({}-{}): ".format(MINIMUM_MONTH, MAXIMUM_MONTH)))

# Using string concatenation and explicit type conversion 
month = int(input("Enter the month number (" + str(MINIMUM_MONTH) + "-" + str(MAXIMUM_MONTH) + "): "))

# Using f-strings
month = int(input(f"Enter the month number ({MINIMUM_MONTH}-{MAXIMUM_MONTH}): "))
```

There's also old-fashioned %-formatting, but it is limited as to the types it supports and is not recommended.  
You might find examples that use %-formatting online, but don't use this.

Note that you cannot simply use commas here like you do in `print`, because `input` does not accept multiple arguments.

#### Test it!

One way to test you've used the constants properly is to change them.

An early Roman calendar had 10 months.
**Change your MAX constant from 12 to 10.**   
Does all the code still work?  
Did ALL the 12's change to 10's?  
Did the first/second half of the month still work... with this one change?

If you had to change BOTH the MAX and the half (from 6 to 5), then you have inappropriately stored derivable data.  
You should notice when values are _derived_ from other values.  
[Here's a note about not storing derivable data in our programming patterns page](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#data-storage)
.

Fix this now, if you didn't do it right the first time.

# Coding Exercises

Write all your answers to the following questions in a single Python file called `programs.py`  
At the top of each program, put a **comment** (starts with a `#`) with the exercise number/name (copy-and-paste it from
here) so you/we know what the program is for later.  
Example:

```python
# 1. Error Checking
worker_level = int(input("Worker level: "))
...
``` 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _By far_, the most common problem that students in this subject make is using poor variable names.  
> Please learn what we teach about naming and follow
> our [Style Guide](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Style-Guide).  
> Good identifier naming is a key learning outcome and a requirement for all practical marking.  
> Do this well! 

## 1. Error Checking

**Write a complete Python program** to print an employee's salary based on their "worker level". Ask the user for their
worker level, and error-check this with an appropriate loop to make sure it is between 1 and 10 inclusive.  
When you have a valid entry, print their salary, which is their worker level multiplied by $5000.

The algorithm will be very similar to the error-checking example above.

Use f-string formatting to make your last output look like currency (2 decimal places), e.g.,

```python
print(f"With worker level {worker_level}, your salary is ${salary:,.2f}")
```

### Sample Output:

```
Worker level: 0
Invalid worker level
Worker level: 11
Invalid worker level
Worker level: 7
With worker level 7, your salary is $35,000.00
```

**Test** this using meaningful test data that you understand.

You will use this error-checking pattern a lot, so get used to it.

Remember that you can **comment out** code so that it doesn't run by selecting the lines of code (doesn't need to be
exact characters, just any part of the right lines) and pressing `Ctrl+/` (Windows) or `Cmd+/` (Mac).

## 2. Number Sequences

* a. Write a loop that displays all the odd numbers between 1 and 100 with each number on its own line (normal print, no
  sep/end). Think about the `step` value for this.
* b. Write a loop that displays all the Summer Olympic years (every 4 years) between 1896 and today, with a space
  between each one (all on one line).
* c. Write one more loop that represents any meaningful sequence. Explain your chosen sequence in a comment.

Remember that one of the first things to do when analysing problems like these is to decide on *definite* vs.
*indefinite* repetition.  
Get into the habit of asking yourself that question every time.

## 3. Menus

How do we write menus? Well, ask yourself, "Where have we done this before?"  
Remember we have
a [helpful guide to Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns#menus). It's very
helpful.

For this question, first, **copy and paste the menu pattern pseudocode** from the above guide.  
Then, **modify the pseudocode** to match the program described below.

Write a menu program that prints smiley and frowny faces until the user quits.  
The user should see a menu like this:

    (S)miley
    (F)rowny
    (Q)uit  

Make the program print a smiley face if they press 's', a frowny face if they press 'f', or an error message ("Invalid
choice") depending on their choice.   
When the user quits ('q'), print "Farewell".

## 4. Accumulation

We learned the "accumulation pattern" for calculating running totals in class, and now we'll try it with both definite
and indefinite loops.

### Examples/Patterns

Some general patterns for calculating a running total from user input are as follows.  
Each of these patterns has a different purpose and usage.  
Each algorithm pattern is described below using pseudocode.

#### A. Sentinel

```
SENTINEL = -1
total = 0
get value
while value != SENTINEL
    total = total + value
    get value
display total
```

You would want to use a *sentinel* when:

- you don't know how many values there will be beforehand;
- there is some obvious invalid value you can use to be the sentinel and mark the end.

E.g., calculating the average age of a line of people, where you don't know how many there are beforehand (you can use
-1 for the sentinel).

> [!NOTE]  
> You don't always need a specific value, and you don't need to use a constant.    
> E.g., any negative number could be your sentinel

#### B. Ask-the-user-to-quit

This pattern uses a Boolean variable to control the loop.

```
total = 0
is_finished = False
while not is_finished
    get choice
    if choice is quit
         is_finished = True
    else
         get value
         total = total + value	
display total
```

You would use the *ask-the-user-to-quit* pattern when:

- you don't know how many values there will be beforehand; but
- there is no particular value that could mark the end of the sequence (all possible inputs could be valid).

E.g. calculating the total net worth of a group of people of an unknown size - you can't use a sentinel, because net
worth can be positive (more assets than liabilities), zero, or negative (more liabilities than assets).

#### C. Definite count

```
total = 0
get count
repeat count times
    get value
    total = total + value
display total
```

You would use the *definite count* pattern whenever the number of values can be entered beforehand.

E.g., calculating the average test score of the class - we know how many students there are beforehand.

*Now it's your turn...*

### Average Age

Write a program to calculate the average age of a group of unknown size.  
Use the **sentinel** pattern from above.  
Hint: you will need to keep track of the total age, and the number of people, separately.

### Smileys Count

Create a new program (with the heading "Smileys Count") and copy your previous
smiley/frowny program from above.  
Modify this version so that when the user quits, the program tells them how many smileys and how many
frownies they printed.  
Hint: you will need to keep track of the two counts separately. (Don't keep track of invalid choices.)

### Total Numbers

Write some code that asks the user for a number of repetitions, then asks for that many numbers and adds them up.  
Is this definite iteration (we know how many times it will run), or indefinite (we don't know)?

Sample output would look like:

```
How many numbers do you want to add up? 3
Enter number 1: 7
Enter number 2: 3
Enter number 3: 15
The total of those 3 numbers is 25
```

## 5. Guessing Game

In the lecture, you were given an example like:

```python
SECRET = 6
guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
while guess != SECRET:
    print("Guess again!")
    guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
print("You got it!")
```

Make this more interesting by (do each of these *one at a time* before moving on):

- Count the number of times the user guesses, so the program will output something like: `You got it in 3 guesses!`
- Give the user feedback about their guess, so they know if they need to try something higher or lower.

Example:

```
Guess a number: 3
Higher
Guess a number: 8
Lower
Guess a number: 6
You got it in 3 guesses!
```

See the extension section for a challenge to make this game more gamey :)

## 6. Nested Loops

Loops that are within other loops are called "nested loops". They are commonly used for grid-like situations.  
In the lecture, we saw the example:

```python
for round_number in range(1, 4):
    for name in ["Miles", "Ella", "Chet"]:
        print("Round", round_number, "-", name)
    print("---------------------")
```

(Note that the above example uses a list, which we haven't learned about yet - but hopefully you can see how it works.
*You should not use lists for your program.*)

Write a program that asks the user for a number of rows and columns, then prints the numbers to match, like:

```
Rows: 3
Columns: 7
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
```

# Practice and Extension

These final sections in practicals are not _required_ to be completed for marks, but you will definitely find benefit in
completing them for extra practice and to extend yourself.  
The more practice you do, the more you develop and "lock in" your new skills.

Create a new file, `practice.py` to complete these tasks in:

## Loopiness

Write a loop that continually asks you for any string and then prints it, until you just press Enter (the empty string
is ""). E.g., you type bob, it prints bob, you type hello, it prints hello, you press Enter, it stops.  
(This is indefinite iteration - we don't know how many times it will run.)

## Turn-on

Write a program that asks the user to enter either "on" or "off", and error-check this input until they choose one of
these.  
Then print either "the light is on" or "the light is off".  
Think about your condition carefully before you run your program to test it.

# Extension

#### 1. Times Tables

Write a program to generate the 15*15 multiplication table.  
To get the spacing nice, note that `"{:4}".format(number)` will make `number` take up four spaces.

```
   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15
   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24  26  28  30
   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36  39  42  45
   4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40  44  48  52  56  60
   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75
   6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60  66  72  78  84  90
   7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70  77  84  91  98 105
   8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80  88  96 104 112 120
   9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90  99 108 117 126 135
  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100 110 120 130 140 150
  11  22  33  44  55  66  77  88  99 110 121 132 143 154 165
  12  24  36  48  60  72  84  96 108 120 132 144 156 168 180
  13  26  39  52  65  78  91 104 117 130 143 156 169 182 195
  14  28  42  56  70  84  98 112 126 140 154 168 182 196 210
  15  30  45  60  75  90 105 120 135 150 165 180 195 210 225
```

#### 2. Random Secrets

See if you can figure out how to make your guessing game random, so it's not always whatever the SECRET constant is set
to.  
Do this by:

- Open the Python Console (down the bottom in PyCharm)
- Type `import random`
- Type `help(random.randint)`
- Armed with that information, write code to generate a random number.

Quick note: Before you start _using_ the random number as a secret, you need to know that your program is generating it
properly, so just print it as soon as you've generated it to check this out.

Then, when you have that working, extend the program so that it has minimum and maximum (constants) that are used in the
prompts and generating the random secret number.

#### 3. Loopy Loops

Write a new version of your nested loops program that runs like:

```
Rows: 3
Columns: 7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 
3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

#### 4. Seriously Loopy

Write a program that works like the output below.  
Hint: use mod (`%`)

```
Rows: 7
Columns: 10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 
1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 
1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 
1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 0 
1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 
```
