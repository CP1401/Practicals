CP1401 Practical 8 - Lists - Suggested Solution
Test Scores
Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 test scores between 0 and 100.
The program should display a JCU grade for each score and also the average test score.

NOTE: Please remember that solutions are there to help you learn from...
AFTER you have attempted and tried your best.
Do not copy the solutions. Simply copying is not a good way to learn.
