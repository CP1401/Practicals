Lists Warmup - Part 1
1. numbers[0] = 10
2. numbers[-1] = 81
3. numbers[3] = 81
4. 20 in numbers = True
5. 1 in numbers = False
6. numbers[1] + numbers[2] = 60
7. len(numbers) = 4

Lists Warmup - Part 2
1. Change the first element of numbers to 1:
   numbers[0] = 1
2. Change the last element of numbers to 4:
   numbers[-1] = 4
3. Check if 1 is an element of numbers:
   1 in numbers
4. Print the second value in the list multiplied by 10:
   print(numbers[1] * 10)
